.SH LIST ACTION
.PP
The List action queries the server for a list of matching jobs, and
displays the result list.
Optionally the definitions of the matching jobs can be stored in a
file if \f[B]-f\f[] is specified.
.PP
The jobs can be specifed explicitly by ID using the
\f[B]-i/--idlist\f[] option.
Otherwise they are searched using the options as filter criteria,
and all matching Jobs are returned.
.PP
If no options to the list action are supplied, then all Jobs on the
server are returned.
.PP
\f[I]Examples\f[]
.PP
List all jobs on the server:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs
\f[]
.PP
List only a single job by ID:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs\ -i\ 123
\f[]
.PP
List a set of jobs by ID and store them in a XML file:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs\ -i\ 1,23,4\ --file\ out.xml
\f[]
.PP
List a set of jobs by ID and store them in a Yaml file:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs\ -i\ 1,23,4\ --file\ out.yaml\ --format\ yaml
\f[]
.PP
List all jobs in the project \[lq]demo\[rq]
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs\ -p\ demo
\f[]
.PP
Output from the command will list the job name, ID number in
brackets, and the URL to view the Job in the server.
.PP
\f[CR]
      Found\ 5\ jobs:
      \ \ \ 1:\ Build\ all\ [38]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/38>
      \ \ \ 2:\ Build\ and\ Update\ Server0\ [31]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/31>
      \ \ \ 3:\ Build\ and\ Update\ Server1\ [17]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/17>
      \ \ \ 4:\ Build\ and\ Update\ Server2\ [45]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/45>
      \ \ \ 5:\ Deploy\ Server4\ [46]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/46>
\f[]
.SH LOAD ACTION
.PP
The Load action uploads the specified file to the server, and the
list of loaded jobs are displayed.
If any Jobs cannot be stored (e.g.
the user is unauthorized to run a certain command), the list of
unsuccessfully created jobs are also displayed.
.PP
The \f[B]-d,--duplicate\f[] option lets you specify what should
happen if any of the Job definitions have the same Name and Group
of an existing Job on the server.
The default option is \[lq]update\[rq], which means to overwrite
the existing definitions with the new version.
\[lq]skip\[rq] means to ignore the uploaded definition.
\[lq]create\[rq] means to create a new Job with the uploaded
definition (hence making the Group+Name non-unique).
.PP
\f[I]Examples\f[]
.PP
Load a file to the server in XML or Yaml format:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs\ load\ -f\ jobs.xml
      rd-jobs\ load\ -f\ jobs.yaml\ -F\ yaml
\f[]
.PP
Output:
.PP
\f[CR]
      Total\ Jobs\ Uploaded:\ 2\ jobs
      Succeeded\ creating/updating\ 2\ \ Jobs:
      \ \ \ 1:\ Build\ and\ Update\ Server2\ [45]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/45>
      \ \ \ 2:\ Deploy\ Server4\ [46]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/46>
\f[]
.PP
If a Job was not successfully created, you will see it mentioned
along with a message about why it failed.
The number next to the Job name indicates the index of the
definition in the uploaded XML:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs\ load\ -f\ jobs.xml
\f[]
.PP
Output:
.PP
\f[CR]
      Total\ Jobs\ Uploaded:\ 3\ jobs
      Failed\ to\ add\ 1\ Jobs:
      \ \ \ 3:\ Build\ Server1\ :\ Project\ was\ not\ found:\ north
      Project\ was\ not\ found:\ north
      Succeeded\ creating/updating\ 2\ \ Jobs:
      \ \ \ 1:\ Build\ and\ Update\ Server2\ [45]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/45>
      \ \ \ 2:\ Deploy\ Server4\ [46]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/46>
\f[]
.PP
If the -d skip is specified, then any jobs definitions that were
skipped will be listed:
.PP
\f[CR]
      rd-jobs\ load\ -f\ jobs.xml\ -d\ skip
\f[]
.PP
Output:
.PP
\f[CR]
      Total\ Jobs\ Uploaded:\ 2\ jobs
      Skipped\ 2\ Jobs:
      \ \ \ 1:\ Build\ and\ Update\ Server2\ [45]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/45>
