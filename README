This is where I will store any ports I make until I have them submitted to official freebsd ports


Included here are the portstrees for:
mcollective-common
mcollective-client
mcollective-server


=======================================================================================================================
mcollective-common 1.2.0
This is required to run mcollective-client and mcollective-server

mcollective-client 1.2.0
requires mcollective-common
    version = 1.2.0

mcollective-server 1.2.0
require mcollective-common
    version = 1.2.0
